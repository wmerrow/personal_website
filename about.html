				<p>I am a data analyst who is passionate about data visualization and conversant in UX, visual design, and front-end web development.  I currently work at <a href="http://graphicacy.com/" target="_blank">Graphicacy</a>, a web development and design studio in Washington, DC that creates interactive data visualization products for nonprofits and think tanks.</p>

				<p>I believe in creating things that are <strong>clear</strong>, something I have focused on in all of my work, both graphics and writing.  I enjoy beautiful visualizations, but I think many are really data art.</p>

				<p>I previously worked in international development, as Special Assistant to the President at InterAction and then as a Princeton in Latin America Fellow with the DREAM Project in the Dominican Republic.  I graduated from Tufts University with a B.A. in International Relations, and have been adding more data work to my roles since then.  Other passions include board game design, progressive politics, and biking around DC.</p>
